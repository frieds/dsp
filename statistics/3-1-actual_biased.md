[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)

>> The mean of actual data: 1.024 children under 18 per household. While the mean of childrens' observations: 2.404 
children under 18 per household. In the latter biased sample, we only surveyed children - meaning we excluded all 
households that have 0 children since there's no children to survey. Therefore, in this unbiased sample, we see a 
much higher probability for multiple children per household and a 0.0 probability of 0 children per household
under the age of 18.

Based on the graph above, we can see a much higher probability (actual data) that nearly half of households have 0 children. Childrens' observations also think there's more children per households in households past 2 children per household than the actual amount of children per household.
